## 🌑 The Philosophy
In an age of surveillance capitalism, "Who you are" has become more important than "What you say".
We are reversing that.

**WhatsInYourMind** is a text-only, follower-free social utility.
*   **No Vanity Metrics**: No Like counts. No Follower counts.
*   **No Algorithms**: No "For You" feed designed to enrage you.
*   **Identity Guard**: You are a Ghost. A voice in the dark.
*   **The Pulse**: A real-time 3D visualization of global emotional resonance.

## 🛠️ The Stack
*   **Framework**: Next.js 16 (App Router)
*   **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
*   **Visuals**: Three.js / React-Globe.gl
*   **Styling**: CSS Modules (Cyber Dark Theme)
*   **Compliance**: Middleware Geoblocking (IT Act 2000 Compliant)
