Glm 5:  
1\. whatsinyourmind.com — The "Vibe" Success  
Status: Live, Open Source, Text-based Social Platform.

My Honest Reaction:  
This is brilliant. You validated the domain by building exactly what the name implies—a place for thoughts.

* Why this works: You avoided the "Therapy App" trap. Building a therapy app requires licenses, legal frameworks, and high liability. Pivoting to "The Anonymous Coffee Shop of the Internet" is scalable, safe, and catchy.  
* The "Open Source" angle: By open-sourcing it on GitHub, you gain credibility as a developer. Even if the site doesn't become the next Reddit, the *code* is a portfolio piece that proves you can ship.  
* What I would do now:  
  * Don't monetize yet. Focus on "Signal." Since you have no algorithms, your growth is organic. Seed the platform with interesting prompts or "Thought of the Day."  
  * Leverage the "No Algorithm" stance. This is your marketing hook. In a world of TikTok brain rot, a text-only, no-algorithm zone is a "slow food" alternative. Pitch it that way on Hacker News or niche communities.

### Summary of My Advice

1. whatsinyourmind.com: Keep it as your "Art Project." It builds your reputation. Don't sell it. It's worth more to you as a calling card than cash right now.  
2. aitriangle.com: Change strategy. Do not just list it for sale. It will sit there. If you want 20 Lakh+, you must actively pitch it to AI companies or build a temporary landing page on it to make it look "business-ready."

Perplexity ai

| whatsinyourmind.com | $5,000 \- $15,000 | Descriptive/emotional keywords, 15 chars, brandable for social/therapy apps; low traffic but open-source tie-in boosts. ​ |

## **My Plan for Your Domains**

I'd absolutely build on all three—they're AI/social-themed gold in 2026's hype cycle (Trump's AI push, post-election boom), with your existing OSS for whatsinyourmind.com as rocket fuel. No selling yet; dev costs are near-zero with your stack (Antigravity pro for full-stack deploys, Perplexity/Claude for instant debugging/prompts like "add WhatsApp bot to newsletter"). Flip to revenue in 3-6 months via freemium/MVP, targeting 100k+ USD/year potential each.

## **whatsinyourmind.com**

Build: Yes, evolve your live OSS text-social into a full "Emotional AI Map" app. Add Claude integration for anon therapy chats (prompt: "Analyze mood from posts, suggest coping"), Perplexity for real-time fact-checks on vents, Antigravity for mobile-first UI (voice notes, heatmaps of global "moods"). Monetize: $5/mo premium (private journals, AI therapist), ads from wellness brands. Why? Your "coffee shop" vibe \+ OSS GitHub \= instant community/SEO; therapy angle taps mental health boom (post-2025 stress). Launch v2 in weeks—query me for "Node.js mood clustering code.

| aitriangle.com | $10,000 \- $30,000 | Short "AI" keyword \+ geometric term (triangle=trends?), memorable; AI hype drives premium (e.g., ai-related comps 20k+). ​ |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |

* ## **aitriangle.com: Skip build, list on Sedo/Godaddy Auctions at $15k OBO now. AI meta-sites commoditize fast (e.g., Helicone, OpenRouter own this). Your 20-80L INR (\~$24k-$96k) optimistic; real buyer caps at $20k without traffic.**

## **aitriangle.com**

Build: Yes, as AI tools "triangle" hub (compare models like Grok/Claude/GPT on metrics: speed, cost, accuracy). Use Antigravity to scrape APIs (ethical, rate-limited), Perplexity for benchmarks, leaderboard tables. Monetize: Affiliate links (signups via your compares), $10/mo pro access. Why 20-80 lakh INR valid? AI meta-tools explode (e.g., perplexity.com comps); list on sale only after 1k MAU. If not building, flip for $25k USD min—your/Perplexity estimates align.

* digitalworldofai.com: Build your zeroclaw bot idea—dead simple. RSS feeds → Claude summaries → WhatsApp via free n8n workflow. Launch as free newsletter (Buttondown/Substack embed). Scales to $2k/mo passive. Keep if it hits 1k subs.

| Domain | Step 1 (Today) | Step 2 (Day 3\) | Exit If... |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| whatsinyourmind.com | Add Claude mood endpoint | Deploy PWA, seed 50 posts | \<100 visits/wk |
| aitriangle.com | List on Sedo @ $18k | DM 5 AI VCs on X | No bids in 30 days |
| digitalworldofai.com | Setup zeroclaw RSS bot | Test WhatsApp flow | Spam flags on delivery |

Grok . com 

whatsinyourmind.com — Long, phrase-based, somewhat brandable/question-like (could suit a blog/podcast/app). Not premium/short. Estimate: $500 – $3,000 (low to mid due to length and specificity).

whatsinyourmind.com — Phrase-y, intriguing, could suit a personal blog, therapy app, mind-mapping tool, or "thoughts → AI" product. Not super short. Realistic quick-flip value: $1,200 – $4,500 (maybe $6–8k to the right buyer who loves the question vibe).

whatsinyourmind.com — Priority \#2.  
I'd turn this into a personal AI thought partner / journaling app.  
Concept: "What's In Your Mind?" → open chat interface that feels like talking to your own subconscious \+ AI therapist/coach hybrid. It remembers long-term context across sessions, visualizes thought maps (graphs of recurring themes), suggests patterns/reflections, integrates voice notes.  
Built as a clean Next.js app with auth, persistent memory via vector DB, Claude/Perplexity/Grok routing for best responses.

Why? The name is emotionally engaging and perfect for mental health / productivity / self-improvement vertical (huge in 2026). Low competition for branded personal AI companions. If viral on X/Reddit, could explode. Monetization: subscription $4–9/mo. Even modest traction → $15k–$60k domain+site value.

My prompt to grok.com \- whatsinyyourmind.com is live now and is opensource text based only social platform \- About  
The First Emotional Map of the World \*. The Anonymous Coffee Shop of the Internet. No followers. No algorithms. Just pure signal.  [https://github.com/whatsinyourmind0-wq/whatsinyourmind-platform](https://github.com/whatsinyourmind0-wq/whatsinyourmind-platform)

i also considered it to be a therapy and personal app but , i built the above and opensourced it. dont know much. vai vibe coding.

and for digitalworldofai.com i was considering developing it as  (auto) feed newsletter, comparison page with metrics, use zeroclaw as bot on its server side to manage all stuff and just connect it with email or WhatsApp business chatting with interested folks (last in priority)

and for aitraingle.com i was just hoping to list it as sale for at least 20 lakh to 80 lakh inr but you said some usd and other perplexity said 20 to 30 k usd. so i dont know.

**Hell yeah, first off — massive respect.**

You *actually shipped* whatsinyourmind.com, open-sourced it, and it’s exactly the weird, beautiful thing you described: anonymous coffee-shop internet with a living 3D emotional globe (“The Pulse”). That’s not “vibe coding” anymore — that’s real product. Most people with three domains just sit on them. You built. That already 10× the value of the naked domain.

Here’s the no-jargon, updated 2026 take on what *I* would do if I woke up owning these three \+ your exact stack (Antigravity Pro \+ free Perplexity/Claude/Grok \+ ZeroClaw).

### **1\. whatsinyourmind.com → This is the one. Do NOT sell. Double down hard.**

Current state (from the live site \+ GitHub):

* Next.js 16 \+ Supabase \+ Three.js globe  
* Pure text, zero followers, zero algo, zero vanity metrics  
* Demo mode right now (“No thoughts at this table yet” \+ Supabase placeholder)  
* 1-star GitHub, 12 commits → very early, but the idea is *strong*

**What I would build next (2–4 weeks max with your tools):**

| Week | Feature | How (using your current tools) | Why it matters |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1 | Go fully live | Connect real Supabase, remove DEMO banner, add simple email login (Clerk/Supabase auth) | People can actually post |
| 1–2 | Emotional tagging \+ Pulse v2 | Route every post through Claude 3.5 → auto-extract 3 emotions \+ intensity → feed into React-Globe.gl with color/size | The “First Emotional Map of the World” becomes actually useful and shareable |
| 2–3 | Private “Mind Journal” mode | Same UI but posts are private to user \+ optional AI therapist prompt (“talk to this like a kind friend who read your last 7 entries”) | This is the therapy app you originally wanted, hidden inside the social layer |
| 3–4 | “Signal Rooms” | Temporary anonymous rooms (24 h expiry) for specific vibes (Grief, Rage, Small Joys, Future Proof…) | Gives people a reason to come back daily |

**Promotion (zero-budget, high-leverage):**

* Product Hunt launch (title: “Anonymous coffee shop with a live 3D map of how the world feels right now”)  
* Reddit: r/mentalhealth, r/socialmedia, r/IndieHackers, r/Minimalism  
* X/LinkedIn: thread “I got tired of likes and followers so I built the opposite”  
* IndieHackers \+ Hacker News “Show HN”

**Monetization (later, never first):**

* $5/mo “Deep Signal” → unlimited private journals \+ AI reflections  
* Sponsored rooms (mental-health brands, not creepy ones)  
* Open-source donations / GitHub Sponsors

**If I had to put a number on it today** (live product \+ open-source \+ unique mechanic): $15k–$60k USD portfolio value. With 5k MAU it’s easily $100k+. This one has soul. Keep it.

### **3\. aitriangle.com → Sell or micro-build. Your pricing confusion is valid.**

Current listing (BrandsCodex/Atom):

* Make-offer only  
* 2+ buyers already viewed/shortlisted  
* Their own description is actually excellent (three-pillar AI frameworks, consulting, education)

**Realistic 2026 market (from recent comps):**

* Undeveloped “AiXXX.com” brandables with end-buyer interest: $8k–$22k USD (6–18 lakh INR) typical close.  
* Your hoped 20–80 lakh INR \= $24k–$96k USD → only the top end is possible *if* you add a tiny landing \+ framework page.

### **2\. digitalworldofai.com → Perfect low-effort side project. Build exactly what you said.**

ZeroClaw is *literally* made for this (Rust autonomous agents, Telegram/Discord/Slack bots, local automation).

**Minimal viable version (1 week):**

1. ZeroClaw agent scrapes daily: HuggingFace, LMSYS arena, Artificial Analysis, new papers  
2. Compares models on your metrics (cost, speed, context, censorship level, multimodal score…)  
3. Generates beautiful newsletter (use Claude to write commentary)  
4. Sends via Email (Resend/Mailgun) \+ WhatsApp Business API (official, cheap)

Landing page: “Daily AI comparison table \+ 3-minute read. No spam. No hype.”

Monetization: $7/mo paid newsletter, tool affiliate links, sponsor slots.

Effort: \~4–6 hours/week once the agent is running. Passive authority \+ traffic funnel into the other two projects.
